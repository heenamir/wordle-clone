# My Wordle Clone

This project is my own clone of wordle. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript while making it. It works exactly like the wordle game we know and love. 
I have implemented dark theme by a button on the top-right corner. 

I took upon this project to brush up my front-end and JavaScript basics, and also to try and host a website on github.
